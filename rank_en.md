Given that the current ranking scoring rules are relatively rough, and the existing site identifiers do not well reflect the models supported by the sites, the following improvements are made:

### Ranking Score

1. Sponsors
    - Sponsor privileges

2. Login Requirements
    - No login required: +10
    - Login required: +5 (including registration, following WeChat official account, etc.)

3. Model Support (Due to the large number of current models, only support for advanced models is counted as bonus points)
    - Advanced model support: +10 for each advanced model supported
